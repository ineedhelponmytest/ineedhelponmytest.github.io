Recently, ineedhelponmytest.com was bought by an anonymous non-profit organization. Why? I have no idea, but they offered me a good amount of money! But of course, I cant let all my work go to waste just for some money. That's why we came to an agreement that they will keep all of the pages I made still reachable, just not from the homepage. Why? I still don't know. If you want to access all of the old pages, click <a href="https://ineedhelponmytest.com/old.html">HERE</a>
